# RIDEMATE (a.k.a. FriendFinder)

Ridemate is a node application essential to cyclists, where they can find people to ride with in places they may be unfamiliar with (like when going on a vacation) and on short notice. The existing resources are great for finding routes or joining rides, but don't allow for this very specific need.

The user can go to the survey page, where he can enter his/her data and preferences; when done, he/she will be presented with a pop-up modal of the rider who can best match that profile. 
Alternatively, links are provided to visit the Project's Github Page or to take advantage of the built-in API which lists all riders.

Happy riding!
